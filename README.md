# parthenium_thesis
Research project for my MPhil thesis, trying to simulate the spread of the invasive plant Parthenium in Pakistan.

Used data from the Sentinel-2 satellite, gathered via Google Earth Engine (no data files are in the repo, 160GB was a bit too big for git (I need to figure that out)).

Initially tried creating a cellular automata simulation, for spatio-temporal predictions of population spread. This proved too complicated for a Masters, so the end simulation is a 1D population model, using infectious disease models.

Also did some extra analysis with indecies and K-means clustering for land types, to help inform and validate the simulation and learn more about Parthenium's behaviour.

In the end, I created a simulation which could accurately match the seasonal variations in population of the plant!

Thesis is included if you want all the details (it's very long).
